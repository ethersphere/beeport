instead of "1 week 6 days remaining", print "1 week 6 days 3 hours 4 minutes 5 seconds" and set the javscript up so that it counts down using local computation/clock. every 1 minute or if a transaction to increase the price takes place, automatically check against the blockchain and see if the value has changed, if it has, update the display. figure out the number of characters that can fit inside TTLDisplay_mainTTL__Y9ZLt at the relevant font width and make a conservative estimation of the maximum length the counddown string can be. if it is too long remove the right most unit of time. 

also, make the balance, expiration date time and countdown time all copy to the clipboard when clicked on
