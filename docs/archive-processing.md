# Archive Processing and Website Creation

## Overview

Beeport provides advanced archive processing capabilities that automatically convert uploaded folders, ZIP files, and TAR files into browsable websites with professional index pages. This system intelligently handles file organization, metadata cleanup, and website configuration.

## Supported Upload Types

### 1. Folder Upload

- **What**: Upload entire directories from your computer
- **Result**: TAR archive with auto-generated website index
- **Best for**: Project sharing, document collections, media galleries

### 2. ZIP File Upload

- **What**: Upload ZIP archives with automatic extraction
- **Result**: Extracted files as TAR with website index
- **Best for**: Compressed archives, website backups, file collections

### 3. TAR File Upload

- **What**: Upload existing TAR files with enhancement
- **Result**: Enhanced TAR with added index if missing
- **Best for**: Existing archives, Unix/Linux file collections

## Automatic Website Creation

### Index Generation System

All archive uploads automatically become browsable websites:

```
Upload Type → Process → Add Index (if missing) → Website Ready
```

#### When Index is Auto-Generated

The system creates `index.html` when:

- No `index.html` or `index.htm` exists in the archive
- Upload contains multiple files that benefit from navigation
- Archive is processed for web serving (automatic for folders/uncompressed files)

#### Generated Index Features

**Professional Branding**:

- Swarm black theme with orange accent colors
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Clean typography and modern CSS Grid layout
- Branded footer linking to ethswarm.org

**File Navigation**:

- Complete alphabetical file listing
- Clickable links to each file
- File type icons for visual identification
- Links open in new tabs for better UX
- Folder structure clearly displayed

**Content Organization**:

```html
📁 Archive Name X files available 📄 document1.pdf 📄 document2.txt 📄 image1.jpg 📄
subfolder/file.html 📄 another-file.zip Powered by Swarm ↗
```

## Smart File Processing

### System Metadata Filtering

Automatically removes system files across all upload types:

#### macOS Cleanup

- **PAX Headers**: `PaxHeader/` directories and contents
- **Resource Forks**: `__MACOSX/` folders and all nested files
- **Finder Metadata**: `.DS_Store` files throughout structure
- **Resource Files**: `._filename` files

#### Windows Cleanup

- **Thumbnail Cache**: `Thumbs.db` files
- **System Attributes**: Windows-specific metadata files

#### Cross-Platform Benefits

- **Clean Results**: No system clutter in file listings
- **Smaller Archives**: Significantly reduced upload sizes
- **Professional Appearance**: Only content files visible
- **Consistent Behavior**: Same experience across all operating systems

### Filename Compatibility

#### TAR Format Requirements

TAR has a strict 100-character filename limit. The system handles this automatically:

**Smart Truncation Algorithm**:

1. Check if filename exceeds 100 characters
2. Preserve file extension for proper handling
3. Preserve directory structure
4. Truncate filename and add unique hash
5. Ensure no filename collisions

**Example**:

```
❌ Too Long (135 chars):
my-very-long-project-name-with-detailed-description-and-version-information-that-exceeds-tar-limits-final-v2.1.3.zip

✅ Auto-Fixed (≤100 chars):
my-very-long-project-name-with-detailed-description-and-version-information-that-exceed_a1b2c3d4.zip
```

## Website Configuration

### Automatic Web Server Setup

When archives are processed as websites, the system configures:

#### HTTP Headers

- `Swarm-Index-Document: index.html` - Sets default page
- `Swarm-Error-Document: error.html` - Custom error handling
- Proper MIME types for all file formats

#### URL Structure

```
https://bzz.link/bzz/REFERENCE/           → index.html (auto-generated or existing)
https://bzz.link/bzz/REFERENCE/file.pdf   → Direct file access
https://bzz.link/bzz/REFERENCE/folder/    → Folder contents
https://bzz.link/bzz/REFERENCE/404        → error.html (if exists)
```

### Directory Browsing

Root URL always shows:

- Generated index page with complete file listing
- Professional branding and navigation
- Responsive design for all devices
- Direct access links to all files

## Upload History and Persistence

### Browser Storage

**Upload History**:

- Stored in browser's local storage
- Cleared when browser cache is cleared
- Can be manually exported/imported
- Does not sync between browsers/devices

### Wallet-Based Persistence

**Storage Stamps**:

- Linked to wallet address, not browser
- Automatically available when wallet connects
- Persist across browsers and devices
- No manual migration needed

**Key Difference**:

```
Upload History: Browser-dependent, requires manual backup
Storage Stamps: Wallet-dependent, automatically portable
```
